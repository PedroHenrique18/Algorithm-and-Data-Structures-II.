# Course Repository - Algorithm and Data Structures II

Welcome to the course repository for Algorithm and Data Structures II. This repository has been created to store important information about the course, projects, and tasks throughout the semester.

In this Algorithm and Data Structures II course, students will explore advanced topics such as algorithm complexity, graphs, and network analysis. The course includes practical projects to apply these concepts, culminating in a Final Project. Data visualization and case studies in areas such as social networks and mobility will also be covered. The goal is to deepen students' understanding of algorithms and data structures, empowering them to efficiently solve complex problems.
